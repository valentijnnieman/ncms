# NextCMS

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentijnnieman/ncms/master/static/img/ncms-logo.svg?sanitize=true "NCMS LOGO")

A CMS built upon Next.js - this is a proof of concept, using Next, Koa, and Mongodb to set up a simple CMS system for blogs and the like.

### What's there

In this example there are posts, an /admin part of the site, and some Materialize css. Support for users will follow soon!

### How do I use this?

For now, you can pull this example and go from there. I haven't gotten around to writing documentation yet, but the `package.json` should tell you what you need. Otherwise, I recommend reading the Next.js documentation [here]("https://github.com/zeit/next.js/")
